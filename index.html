    Let us go then, you and I,<br/>
    When the evening is spread out against the sky<br/>
    Like a patient etherized upon a table;<br/>
    Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,<br/>
    The muttering retreats<br/>
    Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels<br/>
    And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:<br/>
    Streets that follow like a tedious argument<br/>
    Of insidious intent<br/>
    To lead you to an overwhelming question ...<br/>
    Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"<br/>
    Let us go and make our visit.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    In the room the women come and go<br/>
    Talking of Michel-<br/>
    angelo.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br/>
    The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,<br/>
    Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,<br/>
    Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,<br/>
    Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,<br/>
    Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,<br/>
    And seeing that it was a soft October night,<br/>
    Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And indeed there will be time<br/>
    For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,<br/>
    Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;<br/>
    There will be time, there will be time<br/>
    To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;<br/>
    There will be time to murder and create,<br/>
    And time for all the works and days of hands<br/>
    That lift and drop a question on your plate;<br/>
    Time for you and time for me,<br/>
    And time yet for a hundred indecisions<br/>,
    And for a hundred visions and revisions,<br/>
    Before the taking of a toast and tea.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    In the room the women come and go<br/>
    Talking of Michel-<br/>
    angelo.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And indeed there will be time<br/>
    To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I dare?"<br/>
    Time to turn back and descend the stair,<br/>
    With a bald spot in the middle of my hair,<br/>
    (They will say: "How his hair is growing thin!")<br/>
    My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,<br/>
    My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin -<br/>
    (They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!")<br/>
    Do I dare<br/>
    Disturb the universe?<br/>
    In a minute there is time<br/>
    For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    For I have known them all already, known them all:<br/>
    Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,<br/>
    I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;<br/>
    I know the voices dying with a dying fall<br/>
    Beneath the music from a farther room.<br/>
                   So how should I presume?<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And I have known the eyes already, known them all-<br/>
    The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,<br/>
    And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,<br/>
    When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,<br/>
    Then how should I begin<br/>
    To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?<br/>
                   And how should I presume?<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And I have known the arms already, known them all-<br/>
    Arms that are braceleted and white and bare<br/>
    (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)<br/>
    Is it perfume from a dress<br/>
    That makes me so digress?<br/>
    Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.<br/>
                   And should I then presume?<br/>
                   And how should I begin?<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets<br/>
    And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes<br/>
    Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    I should have been a pair of ragged claws<br/>
    Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!<br/>
    Smoothed by long fingers,<br/>
    Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,<br/>
    Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.<br/>
    Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,<br/>
    Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?<br/>
    But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,<br/>
    Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,<br/>
    I am no prophet - and here's no great matter;<br/>
    I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,<br/>
    And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,<br/>
    And in short, I was afraid.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And would it have been worth it, after all,<br/>
    After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,<br/>
    Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,<br/>
    Would it have been worth while,<br/>
    To have bitten off the matter with a smile,<br/>
    To have squeezed the universe into a ball<br/>
    To roll it towards some overwhelming question,<br/>
    To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,<br/>
    Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"-<br/>
    If one, settling a pillow by her head<br/>
                   Should say: "That is not what I meant at all;<br/>
                   That is not it, at all."<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    And would it have been worth it, after all,<br/>
    Would it have been worth while,<br/>
    After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,<br/>
    After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor-<br/>
    And this, and so much more?-<br/>
    It is impossible to say just what I mean!<br/>
    But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:<br/>
    Would it have been worth while<br/>
    If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,<br/>
    And turning toward the window, should say:<br/>
                   "That is not it at all,<br/>
                   That is not what I meant, at all."<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;<br/>
    Am an attendant lord, one that will do<br/>
    To swell a progress, start a scene or two,<br/>
    Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,<br/>
    Deferential, glad to be of use,<br/>
    Politic, cautious, and meticulous;<br/>
    Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;<br/>
    At times, indeed, almost ridiculous-<br/>
    Almost, at times, the Fool.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    I grow old ... I grow old ...<br/>
    I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    Shall I part my hair behind?  Do I dare to eat a peach?<br/>
    I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.<br/>
    I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    I do not think that they will sing to me.<br/>
  </div>
  <div class="par">
    I have seen them riding seaward on the waves<br/>
    Combing the white hair of the waves blown back<br/>
    When the wind blows the water white and black.<br/>
    We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br/>
    By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br/>
    Till human voices wake us, and we drown.<br/>
